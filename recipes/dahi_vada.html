    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Dahi Vada</strong> (<em>Also called Dahi Bhalla in north</em>) is Fluffy, tender, soft, tangy and sweet.
        They are a combination of all your favorite flavors and textures in one tasty snack. They consist of homemade 
        fried lentil dumpling fritters, dunked in creamy whipped yogurt and topped with both spicy and sweet chutneys.</p>
    <p>Dahi means plain yogurt. Vada is deep fried lentils batter. Deep fried vadas are soaked in hot water and added 
        to a slightly sweetened yogurt. Top it with green chutney and sweet chutney. Refer ingredients for the recipes.</p>

    <p>Why I soak in milk not in water?</p>
        
    <p>It makes dahi vada more tasty and balanced. If the curd it too sour, it is not balanced. So instead of soaking in 
        hot water, I soak in hot milk and avoid sweetening the curd as they usually do.</p>
