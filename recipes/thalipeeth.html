    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="left">
    <h5>Thalipeeth Dough</h5>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>First take everything aside from water and oil in a mixing bowl or pan</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon oil</li>
        <li>Mix well</li>
        <li>Add water in parts as required</li>
        <li><p>Begin to mix the dough. Continue this process of adding water and mixing to make a smooth and soft dough.<br>Dough has to be manageable and very smooth. Depending on quality and texture of flour, you will need to add more or less water.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Making Thalipeeth</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Then wet a muslin cloth or a cotton kitchen napkin with water. Wrung the extra water and spread the muslin on the rolling board. The muslin should be moist. Also heat the tawa.</li>
        <li>Now take a portion of the dough. Roll in your palms and flatten it on the muslin.</li>
        <li>With your fingers gently press and flatten the dough to get a flatbread with ¼ inch thickness. While flattening you can sprinkle a few drops of water also on the dough.</li>
        <li>Make hole in the center or make 3 to 4 holes at the sides. This helps in frying the thalipeeth well.</li>
        <li>Spread a bit of oil on the tawa. The tawa has to hot. So you can keep it on medium to high flame. Regulate the flame as required.</li>
        <li>Lift the muslin cloth and gently place it with the thalipeeth side touching the tawa.</li>
        <li>Now carefully peel the muslin from the rolled thalipeeth dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some oil in the holes as well as the edges.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and let the thalipeeth cook for 2 to 3 minutes or till you the base is golden and crisp. You can brown the base more if you want.</li>
        <li>Turn over and continue to cook the second side also till you see some brown or charred spots on them.</li>
        <li>Remove and serve thalipeeth hot.</li>
        <li>If not serving hot, then you can stack the thalipeeth in a roti basket or casserole, so that they stay warm. Prepare all the thalipeeths this way.</li>
        <li>Serve thalipeeth recipe with white butter or fresh curd or pickle or thecha.</li>
    </ol>
