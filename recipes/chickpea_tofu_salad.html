    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chickpea and tofu salad is a new favorite in our family. It is both heart healthy and delicious. 
        It's packed with plant protein and fiber and is also a great option for those who are vegan and gluten free. 
        These days everyone in my family is eating clean and will usually ask me to make a salad bowl.</p>
    <p>This colorful and delicious salad has become part of my salad recipes. There’s nothing like a fresh salad.
        Salads are of course healthy and contrary to popular belief they can be quite filling and satisfying!</p>
    <p>This particular salad is a combination of greens, cucumber, tomatoes, and some fruit which gives it a fresh taste.
        Add in some chickpeas and tofu with my special homemade dressing and you have a great meal! 
        It’s unbelievably tasty and nutritious too! 
        I love eating leftovers all week long. This super delicious salad is full of flavor and textures and is really easy to prepare.</p>
    <p>This recipe will serve 4. It takes 20 minutes of prep time and 5 minutes to assemble</p>
